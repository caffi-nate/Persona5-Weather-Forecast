# Persona5_Calendar
Simple Clock+Calendar based off the Persona 5 Interface

Created as a practice project to solidify understanding in

- HTML5 and CSS3 (basic responsive layout, managing sprite sheets, overlapping elements in CSS Grid)
- ES6+ Vanilla Javascript (getting date/time, applying page transitions)
- External APIs for weather information (openweathermap.org)
