Created as a practice project to solidify understanding in

- HTML5 and CSS3 (basic responsive layout, managing sprite sheets and animations, overlapping elements in CSS Grid)
- ES6+ Vanilla Javascript (getting date/time, applying page transitions and animations)
- External APIs for weather information (openweathermap.org)

Postmortem:
A short, fun project for getting comfortable with CSS/JS fundamentals.
Using CSS Grid for stacked sprite elements was good practice, but became messy very quickly. If I revisited this project I'd love to try displaying elements with something like a javascript canvas instead.
It would be nice to add some more user options for alternative coordinates, too.
